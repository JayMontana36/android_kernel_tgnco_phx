TI BQ5101X Wireless Charger

The bq5101x wireless charger provides the AC/DC power conversion while integrating
the digital control required to comply with the Qi v1.0 communication protocol.

Required properties:

 - status: "okay" or "disabled" for this feature
 - compatible : Must be "ti,bq5101x"
 - bq5101x,mode : Set the default mode, it's an enum value:
			0: WLC and adapter mode
			1: WLC only mode
			2: OTG mode
			3: Disable mode
			(This mode value also relate to the design of en1/en2 gpios)

Optional properties:

 - interrupt-parent :		Interrupt gpio group parent.

 - interrupts :			Specific gpio for interrupt, it should be same as soc_gpio.

 - bq5101x,term_gpio :		Input that allows allows the upper termination threshold to
				be programmable.

 - bq5101x,fault_gpio :		As a CTRL pin pull to ground to send end power transfer (EPT)
				fault to the transmitter or pull-up to an internal rail
				(i.e. 1.8 V) to send EPT termination to the transmitter.

 - bq5101x,en1_gpio :		Inputs that allow user to enable/disable wireless and wired
 - bq5101x,en2_gpio :		charging <EN1 EN2>:
					<00> wireless charging is enabled unless AD voltage > 3.6 V
					<01> Dynamic communication current limit disabled
					<10> AD-EN pulled low, wireless charging disabled
					<11> wired and wireless charging disabled.

 - bq5101x,ad_en_n_gpio :	Push-pull driver for external PFET connecting AD and OUT.

 - bq5101x,chg_state_n_gpio :	Open-drain output, active when output current is being
				delivered to the load.

Example:
&soc {
	ti,bq5101x {
		status = "OK";
		compatible = "ti,bq5101x";
		interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
		interrupts = <&msmgpio 144 0>;
		bq5101x,mode = <0>;
		bq5101x,en1_gpio = <&msmgpio 94 0>;
		bq5101x,en2_gpio = <&msmgpio 95 0>;
		bq5101x,chg_state_n_gpio = <&msmgpio 144 0>;
	};
};
