TI BQ24314C OVP detection chip

The bq24314c monitors input voltage, input current and battery voltage.
In case of an input overvoltage condition, the IC immediately removes power
from the charging circuit by turning off an internal switch. In the case of
an overcurrent condition, it limits the system current at the threshold value,
and if the overcurrent persists, switches the pass element OFF after a blanking
period. Additionally, the IC also monitors its own die temperature and switches
off if it exceeds 140 degree.

Required properties:

 - status: "okay" or "disabled" for this feature
 - compatible : Must be "ti,bq24314c"

Optional properties:

 - interrupt-parent :	Interrupt gpio group parent.

 - interrupts :		Specific gpio for interrupt, it should be same as fault_gpio.

 - bq24314c,enabled :	Specific the device has been enabled by HW or not.
			If use this, it means the device is enabled.

 - bq24314c,ce_gpio :	Internally pull-down chip enable pin, active low.

 - bq24314c,fault_gpio : Open-drain output, indicates device status, low means
			 input overvoltage, input overcurrent, battery overvoltage, or thermal shutdown.

Example:
&soc {
	ti,bq24314c {
		status = "okay";
		compatible = "ti,bq24314c";
		interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
		interrupts = <27 0x2>;
		bq24314c,ce_gpio = <&msmgpio 13 0>;
		bq24314c,fault_gpio = <&msmgpio 27 0>;
	};
};
